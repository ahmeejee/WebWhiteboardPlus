It aims to help designers, teachers, students, and makers stay productive without leaving the browser.

Install (Chrome)
This section shows how to get the extension and run it in Chrome.

1. Open the Releases page and download the packaged extension. The release page contains the build artifact that you must download and execute.
2. If the downloaded file is a .crx or .zip:
   - For a .crx: drag the file into chrome://extensions to install.
   - For a .zip: unzip, then load the folder as an unpacked extension via chrome://extensions > Load unpacked.
3. Toggle Developer mode in chrome://extensions when you load an unpacked extension.
4. After install, pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.

If the release link ever fails or changes, check the Releases section in this repository for the latest build.

Usage and tools
Open a new tab, click the WebWhiteboardPlus icon, and the canvas appears over the page. Use the toolbar to pick a tool. The canvas keeps your drawing on top of the page. You can hide the canvas to interact with the underlying page.

Main tools
- Pen: freehand drawing with pressure-like width control via size slider.
- Marker: semi-transparent stroke for highlight effects.
- Eraser: remove strokes or elements.
- Shape: rectangle, ellipse, straight line, arrow.
- Text: click to add editable text boxes.
- Move: drag elements or selection groups.
- Lasso select: select freeform groups to move or transform.
- Undo/redo: full action history for quick edits.
- Zoom & pan: magnify the canvas, or pan with space+drag.

Export
- Export PNG: full-resolution raster export.
- Export SVG: scalable vector export (keeps stroke paths).
- Export PDF: preserve layout for printing.

Persistence
- Auto-save: the board saves automatically per domain.
- Session restore: reopen a tab and your board restores the last state.
- Export to file: save a board file to back up work.

Keyboard shortcuts
- N: new board
- S: save / export dialog
- Z: undo
- Y: redo
- V: move tool
- E: eraser
- T: text tool
- Shift: constrain proportions while drawing shapes
- Space + drag: pan canvas

Accessibility
The UI uses high-contrast icons and keyboard shortcuts. The canvas supports large fonts and adjustable stroke sizes. The code aims to follow accessibility best practices for color contrast and keyboard navigation.

Security
The extension uses content scripts to draw a canvas overlay. It does not collect user data nor send drawings to remote servers. The code stays local in the browser unless you explicitly export or share a file.
